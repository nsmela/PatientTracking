## Tasks/Tests/Checks
- rename a Test to **Check** because they're checking off things as they progress
- contains:
  - Id -> for database and external reference
  - IsHidden (by default, maybe saved for each user?)
  - IsMandatory (raises alert if not fufiled)
  - Type of check
    - Checkmark (one, or multiple with labels)
    - Text
    - Drop-down list
    - Number Value
    - formula
    - Date
  - Reference (a value this chekc is compared to: another task,a  set value, etc)
  - Tolerance (determines if a check passed based on what the Reference is)
